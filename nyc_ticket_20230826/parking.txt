Dear officer,

On 2023/08/26, Saturday, I drove my family to the City. I found a spot saying "2 hour metered parking". 
I used mobile app, ParkNYC, to pay the parking fee. But my payment was rejected. As I came to the City
last year and it was free to park cars on Saturday. I guessed that it was still free this year. Being a
careful person, I saved a screenshot of the payment rejection. (cannot_pay_parking.jpg). 
The screenshot had a timestamp, 11:29 AM and the zone code. This timestamp will be important for my defense.

I took a picture of the signage from driver's seat. (unclear_signage.jpg).
(The picture was meant to remember the street number and help me come back.)
The picture had the same zone code.
Also the picture's timestamp was 11:30 AM. This timestamp again will be important for my defense. 
(Technology note: the picture's timestamp is in the file's info or properties. 
To see the timestamp, you can right click on the picture in Windows, and select Properties.)

I went out of the car and checked how other cars parked and asked people around about parking.
Right at this moment, a police officer came to check my car. I asked him whether it was OK to park here. 
He said it was for "Commercial Vehichles only". Then I noticed the "Commercial Vehichles only" sign, which was
blurred (shadowed) by the scalffolding.
I told him that I would move my car but he said that he already wrote the ticket.
He said that he couldn't undo the ticket but I could dispute it.

That was the whole situation.

I admit that I missed the "Commercial Vehicles Only" sign. But I dispute the ticket on that
1. The "Commercial Vehicles Only" sign was blurred (shadowed) by the scalffolding. (evidence: picture.)
2. The officer was too rush when he wrote the ticket. (evidence: ticket's timestamp)
3. I sincerely tried to pay the parking in the first place. (evidence: screenshot)

Thank you for looking into these evidences.
