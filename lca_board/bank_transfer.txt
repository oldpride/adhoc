owner vs signer
   LCA is account owner
   you and me are signers

after new lca president is elected, 
   we need to add new president as account signer.
   new signer can authorize other people as signers - to limit on number.
   bank branch can also authorize signer on spot.
   president bring a copy of meeting minutes to the branch, 
      can be an email on phone or a paper copy.
      the meeting minutes can be any one as long as it has an attentee's section, which
      states the title of the new signers.
      eg Tianhua Han (President) Long Chen(Accountant)
      US citizen: driver license + a credit card or any other id
      Non-US citizen: passport or green card + another id (driver license, credit card)
   former president or former signers don't have to come to branch.

one example
   new president goes to bank alone with the meeting minutes,
   bank branch adds him as the 1st new signer
   new president asks bank branch to remove the former signer. done
   new president asks bank branch to pre-authorize another member as 2nd new signer.
   bank branch pre-authorized the 2nd new signer.
   for Chase bank, the 2nd new signer can come to any bank branch in 30 days to complete paperwork.
