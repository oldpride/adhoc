ANDELI 110V/220V 200AMP Aluminum Tig Welder, AC/DC Tig Welder With Pulse Cold Welding Machine
   TIG-250PLS AC DC (Al SUIT)
   ASIN: B092CTBJ5H

the pdf is for TIG-250PL

the seller said:
   Hello, TIG-250PL and TIG-250PLS only use different voltages, 
   and their functions and welding parameters are the same. 
   You can refer to this manual. 
   In addition, we have many practical welding demonstrations of TIG-250PL
   on YouTube for your reference.

to find out what size of Argon gas tank to buy

normal gas flow: 4~5 liter/minute. assume 5.
tank capacity is measured in cubic feet.
1 cubic feet = 28.3 liters
tank of 40 cubic feet (size #2) would last 40*28.3/5 = 226 minutes
should be enough
also, tanks under 80 cu-f are easier to handle and doesn't require a cap.

TIG Welding requires pure Argon gas, which produces a clean weld with no oxidisation.

MIG Welding requires an Argon-CO2 mixture for higher penetration and heat.
